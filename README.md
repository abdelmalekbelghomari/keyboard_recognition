# Audio Forensic Recognition System :mag_right: :keyboard:

Welcome to the Audio Forensic Recognition System repository! Our project is at the cutting edge of security and forensic technology, designed to identify individuals by the unique sound of their keyboard typing patterns and to decipher the keystrokes for enhanced computer security and forensic analysis.

## Overview :page_with_curl:

In the realm of digital security, knowing who is using a computer and what they are typing can be invaluable. Our system employs advanced neural network models to analyze audio data, discern typing patterns, and associate them with specific users. Moreover, our technology can recognize and transcribe the keystrokes, which has a broad range of applications from securing sensitive data to aiding in forensic investigations.

## Features :sparkles:

- **Person Identification**: Utilizing the subtle but unique sound profiles produced by individuals when typing, our system can determine who is using a keyboard with a high degree of accuracy.
- **Keystroke Deciphering**: Our system goes beyond mere identification; it can transcribe the keys being pressed based on the audio input of the typing, which is crucial for forensic analysis and security.
- **Neural Network Models**: We have implemented several machine learning models, optimized with diverse datasets,.

## Getting Started :rocket:
